# CourtCounter
A simple single screen Basketball Score Counter app using java.

Reasons for using Java and not Kotlin : 
1. I am a beginner , still getting the hang of Android dev. 
2. Kotlin is interoperable with Java, since many apps out there are in Java (Kotlin still has a bit of time to take over the market).
3. I personally think Java is a good choice for people just starting learning Android dev and all it's ropes, and then after a while - it'll be good to also learn Kotlin. But that's just my take.
